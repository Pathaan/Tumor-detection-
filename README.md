##YOLOv5
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) is a real-time object detection model thatâ€™s widely used in computer vision applications for identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Developed by Ultralytics in 2020, YOLOv5 is part of the YOLO family of models, renowned for their balance of speed and accuracy, making them suitable for applications where real-time processing is crucial. While earlier versions of YOLO were developed in frameworks like Darknet, YOLOv5 is written entirely in PyTorch, making it more accessible, adaptable, and faster to deploy, especially for researchers and practitioners familiar with the PyTorch ecosystem.
